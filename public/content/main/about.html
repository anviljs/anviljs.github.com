<p>Build tools that require a lot of explicit/declarative instructions are distracting.  Anvil is a build system with an extension-based architecture that prefers convention over configuration. There are a lot of great ways to add new features or change almost any behavior as needed.  </p>
<h3>This Site</h3>
<p>This site is a group effort to document the features and some of the extensions to Anvil. The source to the site itself is hosted <a href="http://github.com/anviljs/anviljs.github.com">here</a>.
If you so desire, you can submit pull requests to add documentation for your extensions or for things about the system you&#39;d like to see covered.  </p>
